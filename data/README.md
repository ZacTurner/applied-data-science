# Datasets

## CSV datasets
All CSV files have (hopefully!) clear column headings

### Dataset 1:
Two CSV files, `temperature.csv` and `humidity.csv`, with all of the rooms in each.

### Dataset 2:
Two CSV files, `temperature.csv` and `humidity.csv`, *per room*.

### Dataset 3:
One CSV file, `data.csv`, containing both temperature and humidity data, with values grouped into 30 second intervals.

## JSON data:
The full cleansed dataset, in one JSON file, `all.json`.
